# ‚úÖ What Happens When You Apply This:
# Kubernetes creates a PersistentVolume named local-pv
# The storage will be at /mnt/data on the node
# It‚Äôs now available to be claimed by a Pod or PVC (PersistentVolumeClaim)

# üì¶ What Is a PersistentVolume (PV)?
# A PersistentVolume is a piece of storage in the cluster that has been provisioned 
# by an admin or dynamically via storage classes. It abstracts the underlying 
# physical storage and makes it available to Pods.

# üîç Explanation of Fields:
#      Field	                                 Meaning
# capacity.storage: 1Gi	           The size of the volume (1 gigabyte)
# accessModes	                     How the volume can be mounted. ReadWriteOnce means it can be mounted by a single node for read/write
# hostPath	                       Refers to a local directory on the worker node‚Äôs filesystem (used for testing/demo only)

# ‚ö†Ô∏è hostPath is not recommended in production because it tightly couples the Pod to a specific node.
