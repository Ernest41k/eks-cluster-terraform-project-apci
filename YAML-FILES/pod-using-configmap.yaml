apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: configmap-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: app
      image: busybox
      command: ["sh", "-c", "env"]
      envFrom:
        - configMapRef:
            name: app-config


# kubectl logs configmap-pod
# This Pod will read the APP_ENV and APP_DEBUG variables from the ConfigMap

# üîç What This Does:
# Field	                                           Meaning
# kind: Pod	                      This creates a single Pod named configmap-pod
# image: busybox	                A lightweight Linux image often used for testing
# command: ["sh", "-c", "env"]	  Runs the env command inside the container to list environment variables
# envFrom.configMapRef.name: app-config	  Tells the Pod to load all key-value pairs from the app-config ConfigMap as environment variables

# üéØ Why This Is Useful:
# You can change app settings without rebuilding your container
# You can re-use the same image for different environments (e.g., dev, test, prod)
# It keeps configuration outside of code, which is cleaner and more secure
