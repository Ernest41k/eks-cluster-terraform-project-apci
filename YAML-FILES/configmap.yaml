# 🔌 How It’s Used:
# You don't run a ConfigMap. Instead, you reference it in a Pod or 
# Deployment (like in example #5), usually by:
# Mounting it as environment variables
# Mounting it as files into a container

# 🧠 What Is a ConfigMap?
# A ConfigMap is a Kubernetes object used to store non-sensitive configuration data 
# in key-value pairs. It’s typically used to decouple configuration from application 
# code, which is a best practice in cloud-native architecture.

# 🔍 What This ConfigMap Does:
# Key	Value
# APP_ENV	development
# APP_DEBUG	true
# This means your application can read environment variables named 
# APP_ENV and APP_DEBUG with the values above.

# ✅ Why Use a ConfigMap?
# Makes your app configurable without changing container images
# Helps promote 12-factor app principles
# Keeps configuration clean and centralized
